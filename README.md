# PHPDB
## PHP Database system
This is an experimental Database system that uses json as it's storage method.
It is written entirely in PHP so it can easily be integrated into all of your PHP web apps.

### How it works
As mentioned before, this system uses the json (JavaScript Object Notation) format to store entries. When a new entry is made, a PHP script creates a new array, then encodes it with json_encode. It then stores the array in a json file, in whichever location is specified.

Thank you for choosing to use PHPDB as your database system.
